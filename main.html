		Inception is a mind-bending sci-fi thriller directed by Christopher Nolan. It follows Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who steals secrets by infiltrating the subconscious during dreams. Cobb is offered a chance to have his past crimes erased in exchange for planting an idea into a target's mind, a process known as "inception." As Cobb and his team navigate layers of dreams, they face challenges that test their limits of reality and trust.
